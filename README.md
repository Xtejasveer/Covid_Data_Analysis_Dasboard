COVID Data Analysis & Visualization
This Python program analyzes COVID-19 data to provide insights on the number of deaths and survivors globally. It also visualizes the spread of the disease using various charts on a Streamlit dashboard.

Features
Data Analysis:

Analyze COVID-19 statistics including deaths and recovered cases.

Summarize global and country-specific trends.

Visualization:

Interactive visualizations of COVID-19 spread across different countries.

Line charts for global death and recovery trends.

Bar charts showing country-specific death rates.

Dashboard:

Built using Streamlit, the program runs on a local server to provide an interactive user interface.

Requirements
Before running this project, make sure you have Python installed. This project requires the following Python libraries:

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

matplotlib: For plotting graphs.

plotly: For interactive plots.

streamlit: For the dashboard interface.

requests: To fetch live COVID-19 data (if applicable).

seaborn: For enhanced visualizations (optional, for styling).

To install the necessary packages, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Prepare your data:

The program requires a CSV file containing COVID-19 statistics. You can obtain data from trusted sources like Johns Hopkins University or any other trusted API.

Run the Program:

After ensuring you have the required data, run the Streamlit dashboard with the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app.py
This will open a local web server where you can interact with the dashboard.

Interact with the Dashboard:

The Streamlit app will display several charts, such as:

A line chart of global death and recovery trends.

A bar chart of deaths per country.

An interactive map showing the spread of COVID-19.

Files
app.py: The main Python script that runs the Streamlit dashboard and handles data processing.

data.csv: Sample dataset for testing the analysis (or link to live data).

requirements.txt: Python dependencies for the project.

Example Data Format
The CSV file (data.csv) should have the following columns:

date: Date of the reported data.

country: Country or region.

cases: Total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases.

deaths: Number of reported deaths.

recovered: Number of people who have recovered.
